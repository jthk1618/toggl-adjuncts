# Toggl Adjuncts - For full-day Time Tracking

1 May 21

Automation and supplementary functions to make 24/7 Toggl tracking easier.

At time of writing, I expect this repo to eventually consist of:

1. cron - Instead of using Zapier
2. installation - Fast installation for new rbpi, vps, etc
3. misc functions - I guess we'll find out as I use it
